- This repository represents **" Face mask detection using MobileNetV2 "**.
- With the help of this project we can detect if a person is wearing a mask or not based on the **Face Detection**.
  
## 📝 Description
- In this project we have used **MobileNetV2** and **Face Detection model** for mask detection .

## 📝 Phases and individual steps for building the face mask detector 
- For detailed architectures of the model You can check the LDD,HDD and the architecture Reports below
